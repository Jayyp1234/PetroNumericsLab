# Computational Petroleum Engineering Lab

![1770449609393](image/README/1770449609393.png)

A growing collection of petroleum engineering simulators, numerical solvers, and physics-based engineering tools built from first principles.

This repository documents my journey from studying numerical methods to applying them in real oil & gas engineering systems — including reservoir simulation, drilling mechanics, production modeling, and field optimization.
